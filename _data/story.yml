greeting: Hi, I'm Ase!

  <b class="font-semibold">"Made with ❤️" should mean more than passion.</b>
  <br>
  If you search "Made with ❤️", you'll get 30 million+ hits. It's a relic from early Web 2.0.
  <br><br>
  <b class="font-semibold">The early Web 2.0 internet was a sandbox, and everyone wanted to play.</b>
  <br>
  Back then, tech meant nerds staying up late, eating pizza, coding weird little things for the hell
  of it. I was 14 then, learning C++ from 1990s library books. People made Flash games and funny
  Twitter bots. People were hopeful about tech.
  <br><br>
  <b class="font-semibold">Now, it's a strip mine with a paywall and ads hyper-optimized to Goodhart's Law.</b>

  <br>
  You want to watch a video, but Youtube plays two ads longer than the video itself. You get pop-ups
  filling half the screen. You need a subscription to keep something you already own. Enshittification is
  the great heat death of the Internet.
  <br><br>
  <b class="font-semibold">Code doesn't live in Git repositories.</b>
  <br>
  It lives on servers draining rivers, minerals mined by laborers, and upkeep costs. Code is born into the
  same systems as us, and when those fail, tech will too. Tech is not exempt from entropy.
  <br><br>
  <b class="font-semibold">We need tech that remembers it's for people.</b>
  <br>
  The industry needs ways to fund innovation without bleeding users dry. Hopefully this is just the
  trough of the hype cycle, the local minimum of tech's gradient descent. Maybe we had to break things to
  learn how to build them right.
  <br><br>
  For that we need compassion. Passion builds things, but compassion builds things that
  matter.
  <br>
  <b class="font-semibold">“Made with ❤️” shouldn’t just mean I cared about making it.<br>It should mean I cared about you.</b>
about-me-part-1: |
  I fell in love with code at 14 on our high school robotics team.
  <br><br>
  As a public school, we couldn't afford sumobot upgrades to compete with wealthier schools, but I noticed everyone used the default out-of-the-box program. We didn't have coding classes, so I taught myself C++ from 1990s books and wrote a program to outsmart stronger robots, landing our first international sumobot win.
  <br><br>
  I later taught it to my coaches and teammates and led the team as we won 10+ international awards within 2 years. (I'm really proud of them!)

  <br>
  Later, I worked on open-source development for a non-profit that taught code to teens in underprivileged areas. Under them, I became the first Filipino to win Google Code-in, was featured on national news, and won a trip to Google.
  <br><br>
  Since then, I've given tech talks, been the head artist for a grassroots org, published ML/AI research in undergrad, and was awarded top Computer Science graduate at the top-ranked Philippine university in 2024. I deeply believe tech should be done not just out of passion for code, but out of compassion for people — the end goal of tech should be to uplift human lives.
  <br><br>
  Outside tech, I sew clothes for my 20+ year-old stuffed bear, Polar. I also have a cat who isn't technically mine but comes here and asks for food. She's silly and I like her.
  <br><br>
  Thanks for visiting my little corner of the internet. <span aria-label="Smiling text emoji">:)</span>
