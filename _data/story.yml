greeting: Hi, I'm Ase!
message: I started coding at 14 on our high school robotics team. None of us, even our coaches, knew C++, and we didn't have programming classes. As a public school, we couldn't afford better hardware, but I noticed even wealthier schools with better robots used the same default program. So I taught myself C++ from 1990s library books and wrote a program that could get our stock robots to compete with better ones, landing our first international sumobot win. I later taught my coaches and teammates, and led the team as we won 10+ international awards within 2 years. (I'm really proud of them!)<br><br>A few years later, I heard about Google Code-in. Thinking I didn't stand a chance, I didn't join. I later joined a week after it started out of peer pressure, and became the 1st Filipino to win and got a free trip to Google.<br><br>Since then, I've done talks on tech and robotics (don't look them up; I was young and cringey â€” now I'm old and cringey), published ML/AI research in undergrad, and was awarded top graduate of BS Computer Science at my dream school, the top-ranked Philippine university.<br><br>Today, outside webdev, I enjoy 3D wooden puzzles, detective games, and sewing clothes for my 19-year-old stuffed bear, Polar. I also collect funny GitHub issues and have a cat who isn't technically mine but comes here and asks for food. I like her.<br><br>Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the web!
