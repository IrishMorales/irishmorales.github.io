greeting: Hi, I'm Ase!
message: I started coding at 14 on our high school robotics team. As a public school, we couldn't afford sumobot upgrades to compete with wealthier schools, but I noticed everyone used the default out-of-the-box program. We didn't have coding classes, so I taught myself C++ from 1990s books and wrote a program to outsmart stronger robots, landing our first international sumobot win. I later taught it to my coaches and teammates, led the team as we won 10+ international awards within 2 years (I'm really proud of them!), and graduated as a leadership awardee.<br><br>Later, I worked on open-source development for a non-profit that taught code to teens in underprivileged areas. Under them, I became the first Filipino to win Google Code-in, was featured on national news, and won a trip to Google.<br><br>Since then, I've given tech talks, been the head artist for a grassroots org, published ML/AI research in undergrad, and was awarded top Computer Science graduate at the top-ranked Philippine university in 2024. I deeply believe tech should be done not just out of passion for code, but out of compassion for people â€” the end goal of tech should be to uplift human lives.<br><br>Outside tech, I sew clothes for my 20+ year-old stuffed bear, Polar. I also have a cat who isn't technically mine but comes here and asks for food. She's silly and I like her.<br><br>Thanks for visiting my little corner of the internet. <span aria-label="Smiling text emoji">:)</span>
