## Status

[![Deploy Jekyll + Tailwind CSS with GitHub Pages](https://github.com/IrishMorales/irishmorales.github.io/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/IrishMorales/irishmorales.github.io/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

## Setup

Your system must have at least Ruby 3.1.x. Run the following:

1. `bundle install`
2. `npm install`

## Scripts

The build process is configured in `package.json` to 1.) process styles using PostCSS, using TailwindCSS as a PostCSS plugin; then 2.) build using
Jekyll into the files under `_site`.

#### Building for development

Run `npm run dev` or `npm run start`

This enables live reload, refreshing the page on any changes. Please note that changes to styles may reload the page twice, as
[live reloading both Jekyll & TailwindCSS may cause issues](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/8470). If changes aren't
appearing, try manually serving the page instead or clearing the cache with `bundle exec jekyll clean` before serving.

#### Building for production

Run `npm run prod`

#### Deployment

Since Jekyll requires some additional setup to work with Tailwind CSS, this site uses a custom deployment workflow seen in `deploy.yml`.
