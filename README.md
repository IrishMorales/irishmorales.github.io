<p align="center">Personal portfolio site designed in Figma & built with Jekyll.</p>

### Setup
Run the following:
1. `bundle install`
2. `npm install`

### Starting the server
Run `npm run start`. This is configured in `package.json` to simultaneously 1.) build Jekyll into files under `_site`; and 2.) compile styles using TailwindCSS into `assets/compiled.css`. Both are configured so that the page should refresh on any saved changes.
